Tested on: Arduino Uno R2, Arduino EthShield SD

Temperature sensor: DS18B20 (TO-92 version)

DS18B20 connections to Arduino:
pin 1 - GND (Gnd on Arduino)
pin 2 - Signal (Digital pin 2 on Arduino)
pin 3 - Vdd (5V on Arduino)
4.7k pull-up resistor between 5V and signal pin - I use 47k resistor, others say 4.7k should be used.
